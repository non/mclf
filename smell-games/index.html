          <h1>Smell Games</h1>
          <p>A series of games I made to play with your nose!</p>

          <h3>I smell you</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>(4-12 players, one blindfold)</h4>
          <p>
            One player (&apos;the smeller&apos;) smells the wrist of each other
            player, one at a time. The smeller is then blindfolded and smells
            each player again in random order. The smeller tries to guess who
            they are smelling. If the smeller misidentifies a player, that
            player becomes the new smeller and the game begins again.
          </p>
          <h3>What&rsquo;s that smell?</h3>
          <h4>(2-50 players, one blindfold)</h4>
          <p>
            All players except one close their eyes. The one remaining player
            (the gatherer) finds or concocts a smell (for example: grass,
            cinnamon, coffee, or soap) and offers it to each player for
            smelling. After each player has had a chance to smell the item, the
            gatherer counts to three and all players shout what they think they
            smelled. Then a different player becomes the gatherer.
          </p>

          <h3>Solo smeller</h3>
          <h4>(1-50 players, closed eyes)</h4>
          <p>
            A player walks around a space stopping at objects, closing their
            eyes, and smelling each object deeply, for at least three deep
            inhales. Player pays special attention to feelings and thoughts
            associated with the smells.
          </p>

          <h3>pea-YOU</h3>
          <h4>(3-50 players, one blindfold)</h4>
          <p>
            A game where players compete to find the worst smelling item. One
            player is the designated smeller, and must be blindfolded. All
            players are divided into two teams. Every turn, each team tries to
            find or concoct the worst smell. At the end of each turn, the
            smeller points at the winning team and says &ldquo;pea-YOU!&rdquo;
            At the end of 5 rounds, the losing team must offer up a new person
            to be the smeller.
          </p>

          <h3>Chose your own smell-adventure</h3>
          <h4>(1-10 players, 1-10 identical zip-lock bags or jars)</h4>
          <p>
            Each player collects a smell in identical jars or bags. All players
            sit in a circle put their jars in the centre of the circle,
            intentionally mixing them up. Each player chooses a jar and closes
            their eyes. Then the players take turns telling a story, each using
            one sentence and integrating the smell in their jar into the story.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you smell it?</h3>
          <h4>(2-50 players, no equipment needed)</h4>
          <p>
            Players are divided into two teams. One player vividly describes a
            recognizable place or experience only by smells while the opposing
            team tries to guess what they are describing.
