				<h1 class="h1">10 GAMES AND LESSONS FROM A MAZE.</h1>
				<hr>
				<p><time class="date" datetime="2016-05-09T04:07:19+00:00">2016-05-09</time></p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve been living, dreaming, and all-out living&nbsp;<a href="http://amaze-berlin.de/"
						target="_blank">A MAZE</a>. Berlin for the past few months.</p>
				<p>I moved to Germany to immerse myself in game-making and spaces of experimental play. I asked around
					about weird game gatherings, and found A MAZE.</p>
				<p>I reached out to A MAZE., and got to work doing experience design, logistics, planning, and problem
					solving.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/a-marie.jpeg" alt="Photograph of me standing next to a frowny face on a painted wall" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption">Onsite, a month before A MAZE.</p>
				<p>A MAZE. Berlin is an experimental games showcase, conference, awards show, party, and cluster of
					unspeakable magic rolled into three venues and an unfolding black box of expanding dimensions.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/a-map.png" alt="Illustration of the venue map - all the buildings are in pink and it is on a black background" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption">A MAZE. Venue Map, by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Santosuke"

				<p>A MAZE. Berlin had 5500 visitors this year. There were 89 games, 41 talks, 9 workshops, and 17
					musical performances. Working on A MAZE. Berlin was exhilarating, creatively inspiring, and
					life-expanding.</p>

				</p>
				<p>While playing games at A MAZE. I found that the mechanics, themes, and stories of specific games
					aligned perfectly with the lessons I was learning on the ground, in my work helping with the
					festival.</p>
				<p>I wrote some of them here: each lesson matched with a game.</p>
				<h2>NO PAIN NO GAIN</h2>

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/TwHwp0T.gif?1" alt="Gif of people jumping into shapes that are projectected onto a wall" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="https://youtu.be/iLOTPBNpGDo" target="_blank">Didablo</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/3ytnx" target="_blank">No Pain No Gain</a></strong>&nbsp;is a
					game about&nbsp;running, jumping, and smashing your body against a wall in specific shapes. Your
					score is based on how perfectly you splatter against
					the wall, as captured by a camera. Your success relies on your commitment to the jump, creativity,
					and artfulness: halfhearted jumps will get you a terrible score.</p>
				<p>Working on A MAZE., there were a lot of wild leaps towards walls. Having never attended A MAZE.
					before, I needed to trust in the process, and aim for perfect form at high speed towards an unmoving
					wall.</p>
				<p>Events are all about creating one perfect moment, whatever the cost. You need to aim unfalteringly at
					your goals, trust in your abilities, and focus on the moment of impact.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson One: Trust in the wall, trust in your vision, and run for it (pain is
					inevitable).</p>
				<h2>LA DISCIPLINE DU RECTANGLE</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.oneliferemains.com/lesdisciplinesdurectangle" target="_blank">One Life
						Remains</a>&nbsp;(France)</p>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8vIXJ7l.gif?2" alt="Gif of a person on a television trying to fit their body inside a moving rectangle. La discipline du rectangle!" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdEm1NfXf8w&amp;feature=youtu.be"
						target="_blank">Sebastian Herrmann</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://www.oneliferemains.com/ladisciplinedurectangle" target="_blank">La discipline
							du rectangle</a></strong>&nbsp;is a very physical game: you are projected on a screen with a
					box around you, and you must stay inside the box. But
					the box is constantly shifting and erratically resizing. You have to scramble and contort your body
					to meet the changing demands of the box.</p>
				<p>Logistics for a massive event always involve making and then shifting plans to meet circumstances.
					You can&rsquo;t control the weather, no-shows, or spontaneously breaking equipment. Each of these
					can impact dozens of other plans.</p>
				<p>Part of good planning is having multiple plans, spreadsheets that fork into different directions
					based on circumstances, and the nimbleness and energy to shift the entire body of the beast when
					needed. Priorities change, materials change, resources
					change, and you must follow, or fail. Part of being in control means knowing what is out of your
					control.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Two: Build nimble plans that easily allow for change (have a backup plan
					for your backup plan).</p>

				<h2>CODEX BASH</h2>
				<p><a href="http://aitchesongames.blogspot.de/2015/04/introducing-codex-bash-at-amaze-berlin.html"

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LRcLvKf.gif?2" alt="A gif of peple running around to try to press big buttons in a collaborative game" class="image-with-caption">

						Aitcheson</a></p>
				<p><strong><a
							href="http://aitchesongames.blogspot.de/2015/04/introducing-codex-bash-at-amaze-berlin.html"
							target="_blank">Codex Bash</a></strong>&nbsp;is a puzzle game with four big, widely-spaced,
					brightly coloured buttons to push. The game is easiest
					to play with four players, as it&rsquo;s hard to solve the riddles while racing from button to
					button. Generally there is a lot of howling: &ldquo;hit the RED button&rdquo;. There will always be
					someone howling &ldquo;RED&rdquo; at you. The trick
					is knowing who to trust before you hit the button.</p>
				<p>Working on a major event, you can&rsquo;t possibly know or manage all the moving parts. You need to
					accept help. Unfortunately, half of all help simply makes more work. The time and energy spent
					communicating, showing, guiding, checking, and correcting
					can sometimes end up being more work than simply doing it yourself. Because of this, it&rsquo;s easy
					to fall into stressful habits of doing everything yourself. This is no good.</p>
				<p>During A MAZE, working with 80+ volunteers, I made a simple rule for myself. If someone offered to
					help me, and it was reasonably easy to accept their help, I would gratefully accept (even if it felt
					like a small task that was easier to do myself).
					However, if managing the help was more work than simply doing it myself (especially if the
					helper&rsquo;s history of helping was high investment/low returns) I would decline.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Three: Always accept help, unless the help is more work.</p>


				<h2>INTERGALACTIC JELLYFISH</h2>

						target="_blank">4Players</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://intergalacticjellyfish.eu/" target="_blank">Intergalactic
							Jellyfish</a></strong>&nbsp;is a game where you spray your arm with some weird gel, insert
					your hand into a decorated cardboard box, grab some peanuts, and give the peanuts
					to a jellyfish. There are tentacles in the box, and you must avoid them or the webcam that is
					helping you to find your way will glitch out more and more.</p>
				<p>Working in any community is all about nuance. Details are everything when it comes to people&rsquo;s
					experience. If you are careless in your work, you will knock over people, you will fumble around,
					breaking connections and obfuscating your own path.
					You must always carefully consider the people and circumstances around
					you,&nbsp;<em>especially</em>&nbsp;if you are an outsider and new to a community. Your awareness and
					sensitivity to the nuance of ecosystems should always be a priority in your
					work.
				</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Four: Respect nuanced community ecosystems or you&rsquo;ll glitch your
					way into failure.</p>

				<h2>GENITAL JOUSTING</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.genitaljousting.com/" target="_blank">Team Swaffelen</a>&nbsp;(Norway)</p>

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PvXeMRA.gif?2" alt="a gif of cartoon genitalia wiggling around in a game" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmcnJyOyu34" target="_blank">Jess Joho</a>
				</p>
				<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmcnJyOyu34" target="_blank">Genital
							Jousting</a></strong>&nbsp;is a game where wriggly penises on a screen vie to chase and
					penetrate each other (and then be penetrated). To play, you need to &ldquo;press
					up to consent&rdquo; on an embellished dildo joystick.</p>
				<p>Consent is sometimes treated like a golden ticket, a one time act that allows for everything after.
					Falling headfirst into a project is a similar thing, where you say an initial yes, and then things
					unfold at you at a rapidly increasing rate.</p>
				<p>Sometimes your perspective or the situation changes and something that was fun becomes distinctly
					unfun. Consent is an all-the-time process, not a single act. Exercising your &ldquo;yeses&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;nos&rdquo; along the way make you better at
					your job, and better at life. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught in a mental loop of unquestioned
					continuance, but you serve yourself and others better when you frequently check in and say to
					yourself: &ldquo;do I want this?&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Five: Ongoing consent is critical to good work: part of consent is saying
					no.</p>
				<h2>OPEN SCREENS</h2>
				<p><a href="http://amaze-berlin.de/content/files/2016/open-screens-schedule" target="_blank">A MAZE</a>.

				<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://amaze-berlin.de/content/files/2016/open-screens-schedule"
						target="_blank"><strong>Open Screens</strong></a>&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t a game, they are a space for
					games: a space where games can be shown for short periods of time. Open
					Screens are a haven for emerging and experimental game-makers.</p>
				<p>Creating this kind of entryway pollinates the entire festival with a feeling of inclusivity and
					possibility. Maintaining ground level access points that are open to new makers and creators keeps
					the festival grounded in the community that holds it
					up.
				</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Six: Creating an accessible entryway fosters inclusivity, possibility,
					and continued relevance</p>
				<h2>DYG</h2>
				<p><a href="http://vvvvvv.ooo/#/dyg/" target="_blank">Burgess Voshell</a>&nbsp;(USA)</p>

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sz06cZG.gif?2" alt="a gif of a big orange sun sinking as someone digs" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="http://vvvvvv.ooo/#/dyg/" target="_blank">DYG</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://vvvvvv.ooo/#/dyg/" target="_blank">Dyg</a></strong>&nbsp;is a game where you
					are trying to dig your own (deep) grave as the sun goes down. The game is visually simple, a sinking
					sun over a single digging player. If you get in
					the rhythm of pressing the keys properly you will dig a deep hole, if you don&rsquo;t, your shovel
					will clank as the orange sun comes closer and closer.</p>
				<p>Working through an event (or living through a life) is similar. If you get in a rhythm, everything
					becomes easier. When you falter and stumble around, you hit a lot of problems, issues, and closed
					doors. When you find your work rhythm, successes seem
					to pile on top of each other. You just need to keep taking slow deep breaths and get through it,
					shovel by shovel.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Seven: Work is easier when you find a rhythm and work through it piece by
					piece (still: life is hard and then you die).</p>

				<h2>KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/" target="_blank">Steel Crate Games Inc</a>. (Canada)</p>

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iMkCIF6.gif?2" alt="a trailer of a game where people are talking frantically to eachother as they try to dismantle a bomb" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgXJuKpa64" target="_blank">Steel Crate
						Games</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/" target="_blank">Keep Talking and Nobody
							Explodes</a></strong>&nbsp;is a game where one player is trapped in a virtual room with a
					ticking time bomb. The other players are &ldquo;experts&rdquo; of various
					types who need to decipher codes and give directions. The experts can&rsquo;t see the bomb, and the
					trapped player can&rsquo;t see the manual: everyone needs to trust each other.</p>
				<p>In event-related work, you need to be a good communicator under enormous pressure. You can&rsquo;t
					micromanage, and you need to rely on other people to do their jobs. It comes down to treating other
					team members with respect, trust, and working on
					better communication rather than snatching the controller.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Eight: Communication and trust are everything (communicate or everything
					will explode).</p>

				<h2>LIEVE OMA</h2>
				<p><a href="http://lieveoma.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Florian Veltman</a>&nbsp;(France)</p>

				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LiBydcE.gif?2" alt="a gif of a beautiful, pink tinted game where a grandma is collecting mushrooms with her grandchild" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="http://lieveoma.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Lieve Oma</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://lieveoma.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Lieve Oma</a></strong>&nbsp;is a game
					about a small child gathering mushrooms with their grandmother in a forest. It&rsquo;s a gentle
					game, immersive and meandering.</p>
				<p>Many of the most important things about communities and spaces can&rsquo;t be articulated through
					emails or rule-sheets, they need to be unspooled through patient presence, through walking and
					working together.</p>
				<p>Knowledge transfer comes in strange and unknowable ways. Some of the most valuable mentoring and
					guidance I received at A MAZE. came from working alongside volunteers, staff, and game developers on
					soft mundanities like lugging cases of water, coiling
					cables, or assembling chairs.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Nine: Some things are only learned working shoulder to shoulder (grandma
					knows best).</p>
				<h2>LUCID TRIPS</h2>
				<p>VR Nerds /&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lucidtrips.com/" target="_blank">Lucid Trips</a>&nbsp;(Germany)
				</p>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/y6ozyi0.gif?2" alt="a gif of someone playing in VR and they are in a psychadelic world where they can fly" class="image-with-caption">
				<p class="caption"><a href="http://www.lucidtrips.com/" target="_blank">Lucid Trips</a></p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://www.lucidtrips.com/" target="_blank">Lucid Trips</a></strong>&nbsp;is a
					Virtual Reality experience which takes place in planetary dreamworlds. You use your arms to leap and
					fly through impossible landscapes.</p>
				<p>It can be alluring when entering a new environment or community to constantly draw parallels with the
					places and people that you know. To make the foreign known by flattening it with metaphor. But part
					of the joy of entering new worlds is in allowing
					the newness, in opening yourself up to the strangeness and the joy of not having answers, not
					knowing anything, being overtaken by otherness and wonder and possibility.</p>
				<p class="blog-lessons">Lesson Ten: Be open to new worlds, to wonder, to entirely alien experiences.</p>
				<h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
				<p>Of course, most of what I learned at A MAZE. is under the surface, rogue, totally unwilling to be
					tidied into a list. If you want me to show you my spreadsheets, I&rsquo;d be delighted, but I
					don&rsquo;t think the magic is there. The learning is in
					the doing.</p>
				<p>Probably that&rsquo;s the way learning should be: inarticulable, living, uncomfortable; coursing
					through subterranean labyrinths of experience and reflection; only accessible by the meat bag who is
					lucky enough to tangled up in it.</p>
