        <h1>Come With Me</h1>
        <p>Who has never felt alone?</p>
        <p>ComeWithMe is a playful virtual exploration of the spaces between people.
          ComeWithMe translates your physical movements into a strange virtual world of animated sculptural forms and
          virtual interactions. Using a camera, AI-based body sensing (LivePose), projection mapping, and immersive
          sound, ComeWithMe explores how we get closer to each other, how we connect, and how we sometimes fail to
          connect with the people around us.</p>

          and invites people to come together and play in physical and virtual space.</p>

          <h2>Why this matters: technology and connection</h2>
          <p>Over the last 20 years, we have watched the rise of social media giants, and seen the act of becoming a
            “friend” or “connecting” with someone reduced to a click of a button. These days, we are relentlessly
            connected and surveilled through technology. Underlying this superficial connection is a growing
            loneliness. ComeWithMe explores relationships through the lens of computer vision, a field of artificial
            intelligence that helps us to derive meaningful information from cameras. </p>

            <p>ComeWithMe asks: how are you
              connected to the people around you? How do you reach for people, and how do they reach for you? </p>

          <h2>What is it like to experience ComeWithMe</h2>

          <p>ComeWithMe is set up in physical space. A strange virtual world is projected on the walls around you creating an immersive feeling. You
          are represented by a strange aquatic avatar. When you move your arms you notice that the tenticles of one of the avatars wobble too. You can move your avatar
          through the world by moving your body, and you can create temporary rope-like connections with others by moving closer
          to them and reaching for them. You can catch or evade flying spheres. Together with other people you navigate the strange
          world.</p>

          <!-- <h2>What is ComeWithMe?</h2>
          <p>In concrete terms, ComeWithMe is a playful interactive installation. It is something you can interact with by moving your physical body in space. It is designed for multiple people at once. The people see changing visuals that are projected on the walls and hear changing sounds. When the people move their bodies, these sounds and visuals change. I have a working prototype, but would like the time and space to make it more immersive, connecting, and moving.</p> -->

        <h2>Metalab Residency</h2>
        <p>I made the above prototype of ComeWithMe during a 6-month residency at the Metalab at the SAT in 2022, using the
          Metalab-developed open source pose estimation tool (LivePose) and open source projection-mapping tool
          (Splash). I’ve always loved doing residencies. There’s no better way to immerse in a community and become part
          of a world than to literally dive in. </p>
          <img src="../img/blog-images/cwm-meta.png" alt="code and a debug page on a screen" class="wide-image image">
       

        
        <p>I’m dreaming of developing ComeWithMe further through deeper experimentation.</p>
        <p>Currently, ComeWithMe is a playful, immersive, installation that is projected onto two adjoining walls in the
          installation area, creating a visual sense of immersion. A special LiDAR depth-sensing camera is pointed into
          the area. Audio speakers are be arranged around the installation area, creating a spatial
          soundscape.</p>
        <p>Without participants, ComeWithMe is a lonely world, with soft purple lighting, subtle organic plant-like
          shapes, and soft, deeply reverberating music.</p>
          <div class="vidContent">
            <iframe title="Common Video" width="560" height="315"
              src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KtbkfDF2SQ?autoplay=0&showinfo=0&loop=1&rel=0"
              frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
        <p>When participants enter the installation area, ComeWithMe comes to life. Each participant in the installation
          area is represented on the screen by a vibrant, organic, humanoid “character” that moves its limbs as the
          participant does, and floats around the immersive world, like a virtual avatar.
        </p>
        <p>As the characters reach for things in the virtual world, flowing ropes emerge from their hands. When two
          participants reach for each other, they become connected by flowing strands of multicoloured rope and matching
          melodic waves of ambient sound.
        </p>

        <p>Participants try to build these connections (flowing digital ropes) by reaching for each other. Larger
          groups can form or people can pair into smaller groups. By mutually and repeatedly reaching for each other,
          participants can strengthen connections, which otherwise visibly and audibly decay over time. The decay
          are slow and gently rhythmic, inviting gentle dance-like motion from the participants.
        </p>
        <p>Two kinds of small sculptural objects float past the participants periodically: some sharp and bright, some
          rounded and pulsing. Participants avoid the sharp objects as these sever connections and temporarily
          remove all colours from a cluster. Participants reach for the rounded, pulsing objects as they create
          delightful washes of colour and sounds.
        </p>
        <p>An ambient, sonically immersive soundscape provides a subtly shifting audio backdrop as connections form
          and decay.
        </p>
        <p>Each participant group brings its own relational presence to ComeWithMe, no two encounters are the
          same because, at its core, it explores the space between specific people in a specific moment in time. I see
          this space as a space of incredible possibility. How does it work? How can it be activated? What happens when
          a whole network of these spaces becomes active? What changes occur outside of and within us when we feel
          connected with the people around us?
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Having developed a prototype of ComeWithMe in 2022, my goals for 2023 are related to deeper experimentation. It's wonderful to have a working prototype because every direction from here is an improvement.</p>
        <p>My aim is to use my current prototype of ComeWithMe as a scaffold and playground for research into connection
          while experimenting with the technologies and tools at the Metalab. The project may shift
          drastically as I experiment, take risks, and learn.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>I am interested in making ComeWithMe accessible to as many people as possible. I explore accessibility through testing with diverse audiences and make design decisions accordingly about elements like speed/slowness, forgiveness of control (rather than precision), communicating critical information through both sound and sight (allowing people to engage using only one or only the other), and reducing cognitive load. All that said, accessibility is an ongoing process and is never done.</p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>ComeWithMe uses open source tools developed by the MetaLab at the SAT: LivePose and Splash.</p>



        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>My work is always made in community. I like to learn and teach as I learn. The prototype was made by me, but with the support of my commmunity. Huge thanks to Julia Evans (helping me with OSC) Steven Sych (technical art and making things pretty),
          Kristian North (sound design and making things sound good), Jonathan Carroll (teaching me Unity stuff), Elder
          Nina de Shane, Ida Toft, Mike Daoust (Unity help), Adam Streck (Unity help), Aaron Levin,
          Matthew Gooding and Monique Gurule (daily support), Luis Miguel Barbosa Costa Leite (conversations about
          puppets), George Batchelor, Cabbibo (rotation conversations), Leslie Predy and Jenn Kitagawa (testing).

          To the people of the Metalab, especially Michal Seta (support throughout), Alexandra Marin, Édith Viau,
          Emmanuel Durand, Mourad Bennacer, Christian Frisson, Nicolas Bouilllot, Farzaneh Askari, Thomas Piquet,
          Eduardo Meneses, Émile Ouellet-Delorme, Victor Comby, Elies Jurquet, and Eva Decorps.
