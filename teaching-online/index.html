        <h1>Teaching online: <br><span class="subtitle">Challenges, Tactics, and New Possibilities</span></h1>

        <p>Learning online isn’t easy.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to get distracted, disconnected and overwhelmed. And then there are the technical problems.</p>
        <p>Below I share five problems I've noticed when teaching online, and how I work with them. I also list some new
          advantages and affordances.</p>

        <p>I have experience with teaching, online communities, and technology, so I hope I have something useful to
          share here. </p>

        <p>If you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them.</p>

        <h2>5 Challenges When Teaching Online</h2>


        <h3>1. Getting distracted - How can we help people stay focused online?</h3>


        <p>When we sit down to learn at our devices it’s easy to be carried away by the infinite scroll. Especially in
          times of high stress. And our natural deterrents - energetic human presence, the excitement of sharing
          physical space, the
          social pressure to pay attention - it's all totally gone.</p>

        <p>Tips to build attention:</p>
        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Anchor everything in purpose:</span> Make space for people to define learning goals and
            motivations. Why are we here?</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Discuss distraction:</span> It makes sense to be distracted right now. Brainstorm
            together why we are distracted and how we can help ourselves and each other.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Break it up:</span> Number and communicate the key steps that lead towards our goal.
            (“Now we are on step 3/5, how to fold the wings of the paper plane”).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Participatory processing:</span> Make time to process information with spoken words,
            written words, movement, or drawing.</li>
          <li><span class="blue"><span class="highlightme">Interaction breaks distraction</span>: </span> Use exercises,
            group conversation, chat, breakout rooms, and anything else you can dream up. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invite curiosity:</span> Make space for learners to have questions before discussing
            answers. Seed questions like: “what do you think will happen if we do this?”</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invest time in playfulness and joy:</span> channel your own curiousity and enthusiasm.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Feeling disconnected: How to build intimacy and connection online?</h3>

        <p>We are missing physical energy, important biological signaling, and subtle interpersonal feedback when we
          interact online. Instead we have awkward pauses, miscommunications, and people accidentally speaking over each
          other. It’s easy to
          feel disconnected and alone.</p>

        <p>Tips to build connection:</p>

        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Keep it personal:</span> Welcome people when they arrive by name. Allow people to feel
            your warmth and the friendly weight of human interaction.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Do a check-in together:</span> Everyone should be heard and everyone should hear the
            others.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Celebrate the experimental</span> state of online learning. Building something together
            fosters vulnerability and connection.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Design for connection</span> with low-pressure collaborative exercises.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule time</span> for questions and emergent connection between people.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Co-create structure:</span> Expectations related to behaviour should be created
            together (The image below is a sample from a workshop I teach).</li>

        </ul>

          class="wide-image">

        <h3>3. Feeling overwhelmed - How can we support each other while we renegotiate everything?</h3>

        <p>We are all in a drastically new situation. Most of us are facing extreme stress and anxiety about an
          uncertain future. And now we need to move our lives online. Unfortunately, many of our supports and coping
          strategies don't translate to
          the internet. We have to do the strenuous work of re-negotiating and re-adapting to meet our needs. </p>
        <p>Tips to help ground and support people online</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate support:</span> Tell learners explicitly that you want to help them meet
            their own needs in a way that works for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Learner first:</span> Respect that learners come with valuable pre-existing knowledge
            and goals.</li>

          <li><span class="blue">Design for flexibility:</span> Support different learning styles and needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Take care of bodies:</span> Include regular stretching, deep breathing, or time-out
            breaks in the schedule.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Honor the structure:</span> Begin and end the lesson on time to help everyone manage
            cognitive and emotional resources.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Patience:</span> Bring kindness to ourselves and others. We are adapting to totally new
            systems while living through a crisis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Feeling Lost - How can we notice lost learners and help them get back</h3>


        <p>There are many ways for people to become lost online. Technology can fail, communication can fail, and people
          can miss a step or get lost in exploration. Unfortunately, it is also much harder to notice when learners fall
          away online.</p>
        <p>Online shepherding tips:</p>

        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Organize content and check-in:</span> Check-in at each key step to ensure that no-one
            has missed a step, has a question, or is feeling lost.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Encourage questions:</span> Make sure learners know when and how they can ask their
            urgent and less urgent questions.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Loop everyone together after any pause or question:</span> Clearly state that you are
            moving on. Check especially for learners who lost focus in the pause.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Ask for a yes:</span> When checking in, ask for a yes (“hands up if you see this on
            your screen”) instead of a public admission of failure (“is anyone lost?”)</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Use repetition and reviews:</span> Rephrase and recap frequently to help learners
            bridge lost moments and reinforce learning.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Follow up:</span> After a lesson send a short message listing important takeaways or
            assignments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Tech fails: How do we deal with technology?</h3>

        <p>Everything online is mediated by patched-together chains of complex technologies. Technology will always
          eventually break, and it can be extremely stressful and disruptive. </p>
        <p>Tips to avoid and manage tech failures:</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Choose technologies/tools thoughtfully:</span> Every tool and technology will exclude
            some people. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Test tools before using with learners:</span> Use different computers, phones, tablets,
            and browsers.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">List common problems and solutions:</span> Take time to list common problems and
            strategize solutions for each. Every technical problem our learners have is now also our problem.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate about technology in advance:</span> Ask learners directly for any needs,
            preferences, and concerns about technology and learning. Check-in to ensure the systems are actually working
            for learners.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule a buffer period:</span> Take 5-15 minutes on the first day to check everyone's
            tech: internet (<a target="_blank" href="http://fast.com/">25 megabits/sec min</a>); external power;
            software updates; microphone
            and video
            (turn on and off for practice); quiet location.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Decide together on webcams:</span> (on or off). Keeping cameras on drastically improves
            energy, communication, and accountability. But it also impacts access for people who don't have internet
            bandwidth and can make
            people feel uncomfortable.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Some tech fails are unavoidable:</span> We do our best. Channel humour and patience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/to-possibilities.png" alt="People connecting across the world" class="image">


        <h2 id="newpossibilitieswhenteachingonline">New possibilities teaching online:</h2>

        <p>Thinking about challenges and barriers is useful. But new platforms also come with new possibilities. We can
          look to <a href="https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29607/24772">crip</a>
          communities, MOOCs, and early
          internet forums, for inspiration and leadership.</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Asynchronous learning:</span> with recorded content, learners can learn at times that
            work for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Larger audiences:</span> we can easily share with many people instead of few.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">General accessibility:</span> content online can be more accessible for some people.
          </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Reusable content:</span> content can be reused and remixed in creative ways.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Lower barrier to entry:</span> if you are reading this, you could design and teach a
            workshop right now.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Collaboration and proximity:</span> teachers and learners can be anywhere in the world
            or time zone.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Cost:</span> lower costs related to location (rent, maintenance, furniture).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Flexible Speed:</span> learners can speed up and slow down recorded content to meet
            their needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Closed captions:</span> closed captions and transcripts are easier to generate.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Language:</span> recorded content is easier to translate and make accessible in other
            languages</li>
          <li><span class="blue">New hybrid experiments:</span> for example: we can record a series of micro lecture
            videos to use while teaching: we benefit from quality edited content while having the energy of live
            interactions.</li>
