				<h1>Experience Design: <br><span class="subtitle">Transforming Problems into Joyful Experiences</span>
				</h1>
				<p>I wrote this post to share how and why I design experiences. I hope you'll walk away with some
					questions you can ask and tools you can use to think about designing better experiences.</p>
				<h2>Why I design experiences</h2>
				<p>I knew something was wrong when a medical intake form drove me into a tree.</p>
				<p>The receptionist gave me a form on a clipboard with a pen and the next thing I knew I was running out
					the door and climbing to the top of a nearby tree.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-tree.png" alt="Drawing of me in a tree" class="image">
				<p>But it took me years to realize that most people don't feel like there are tiny blades stabbing their
					eyeballs when the lights are too bright. That most people’s throats don’t close up when a person in
					the room wears too much perfume.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-perfume.png" alt="Drawing of perfume bottle" class="image">

				<p>Many people can fill an intake form, pay a new bill, or book a trip without watching their own brains
					shriek and howl and claw through error pages until something as simple as copying a passport number
					becomes impossible.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-passport.png" alt="Drawing of a passport" class="image">

				<p>But all of us are struggling. We grit our teeth and navigate broken websites, broken systems, and
					inhumane experiences. Sometimes we complain, but often the systems for lodging a complaint are
					broken too.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-gritting.png" alt="Drawing of creature gritting teeth" class="image">

				<p>To understand a product, a space, or a service we need to understand it in relation to the living
					beings experiencing it. All the spaces, services, and even products we encounter can be understood
					as experiences. </p>


				<!-- <p>Experience design is a mandatory exercise for me. I design experiences because I can’t function with things the way they are. </p> -->
				<h2>Why do bad experiences matter?</h2>
				<p>We are each born with a specific set of circumstances outside our control and some DNA. The rest of
					who we are and who we will become is shaped by our experiences: the spaces and things that shape us
					as we shape them.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-dna.png" alt="Drawing of DNA" class="image">

				<p>Our experiences are shaped by the structures and spaces that contain our lives. These might be
					offices, prisons, hospitals, airports, or waiting rooms. These could be government services,
					insurance reporting forms, job interviews, or traffic jams. They could be conferences, music shows,
					or meetings. Increasingly, these include social media platforms, email inboxes, and apps. </p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-computer.png" alt="Drawing of person using a computer" class="image">

				<p>Many of these spaces generate misery. Who is in charge of designing and planning these experiences,
					and why are they so terrible for so many of us?</p>
				<h2>Why are experiences bad?</h2>
				<p>Here are some of the reasons why experiences are poorly designed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Resources</strong>: There aren’t enough resources to design or build a better
						experience. </li>
					<li><strong>Valuation</strong>: Design of experiences isn’t understood or considered a priority.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Constraints</strong>: There are limitations or intertwined systems constraining the
						experience. </li>
					<li><strong>Manipulative Design</strong>: Designed to control or funnel behaviour to specific ends.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Hostile Design</strong>: Intentionally uncomfortable to discourage use. </li>
					<li><strong>Overengineering</strong>: Experience is rigidly defined with more rules than substance
						(like bureaucracy). </li>
					<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: Reproduction of frameworks that historically seemed to work, but
						no longer apply. </li>
					<li><strong>Mono</strong>: Experience is designed to reflect the goals or needs of a single person
						(guess who) </li>
					<li><strong>Averaging</strong>: Designed to work for an imaginary average person. </li>
					<li><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Experiences were designed once and are considered complete forever.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Tunnel Vision</strong>: Driven by a key metric (like sales) at all costs, without
						considering the environment that produces the metric. </li>
				</ul>
				<h2>How I design experiences</h2>
				<p>When I design experiences, I consider the space not as an object or product or an event, but as an
					experience: a space of possibility; a set of opportunities and constraints; something that we move
					through, interact with, that we help to shape, and
					that shapes us.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-mydesign.png" alt="Drawing of scribbles" class="image">

				<p>I’m inspired by all the bad experiences I’ve ever had or witnessed. And each broken system, each
					precious moment we dump into structures that carelessly grind away the human spirit, I see as
					inspiration for something better. </p>
				<p>I design experiences to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Grow peace, joy, and flow </li>
					<li>Uncover patterns in the noise </li>
					<li>Open access paths for people who think, move, and function in different ways </li>
					<li>Build supportive constraints and destroy deforming constraints </li>
					<li>Grow space for people to meet their needs </li>
					<li>Design for what we are, and what we want to be </li>
					<li>Listen and build and listen again </li>
				</ul>

				<p>Experience design is not a pipeline: it is a flow of experiences through, underneath and around the
					project. And for me, the design process can be understood as an ongoing interaction between
					listening, design, and experimentation. </p>

				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-cat.png" alt="Drawing of a happy cat" class="image">

				<h2>Start by asking questions</h2>
				<p>When I'm designing experiences, the first questions are always pointing inward. Here are a few sample
					questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Why are we here?</strong> Are we together on what matters to us, what binds us, what
						pulls us forward? </li>
					<li><strong>Who are we?</strong> Are we the right people to do this work? Is everyone here who
						should be here? </li>
					<li><strong>Are we in?</strong> Are we emotionally committed? Do we have resources? </li>
					<li><strong>What is our work space?</strong> What is the overlapping space between what people want
						from us and what we want to give them? </li>
					<li><strong>What do we want people to feel?</strong> What do we want people to feel, think, say?
					</li>
					<li><strong>What do we believe?</strong> What are our pre-existing theories, assumptions,
						observations, and stories?</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-questions.png" alt="Drawing of a person asking a question"
					class="image">

				<h2>Listening to people</h2>
				<p>To design experiences, we need to listen to the people we are designing with and for. We need to do
					more than ask questions at a diverse group of people and write down their responses. It’s not enough
					to group people into personas, speculate with sticky notes,
					and call it empathy.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-stickynotes.png" alt="Drawing of personas board with sticky notes"
					class="image">

				<p>We need to listen responsively, opening ourselves to a variety of listening tactics: stories,
					metaphors, images, play, data, interviews, and on-site interactions. Experiential truth is something
					that needs to be experienced to take shape. </p>
				<p>We must be consent-driven in our practice, continuously open to our unexamined bias, deeply skeptical
					of all speculative empathy, and diligent in our validation. </p>
				<p>A few questions to consider:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Who are we talking about?</strong> Can we make a list of everyone who touches our work?
						Who is missing? How will we order the list? Who do we want to grow towards? </li>
					<li><strong>Why are people here?</strong> What are their needs, motivations, feelings, and values?
					</li>
					<li><strong>Where is the joy?</strong> Are there parts of our experience that bring people joy?
					</li>
					<li><strong>Where are the barriers?</strong> Social, knowledge, financial, physical? Full, partial,
						unknown? </li>
					<li><strong>How does the experience flow?</strong> Map it out. Consider things like motivations,
						barriers, values, desire paths, loops, choices, points-of-joy, interactions and goals. </li>
				</ul>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-experience.png"
					alt="Drawing of lines and shapes signifying experience design" class="image">

				<p>We understand our research as what it is: an abstraction. To conduct our research we abstract,
					dissect, categorize, and generalize. All this is useful, so long as we remember that there is no
					meaningful way of understanding a single experience outside
					of the complex and lived whole. </p>
				<h2>Scaffolding</h2>
				<p>It's useful to build a temporary structure of understanding after the intense open curiousity of
					research work and before we jump into experimentation. This can include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Setting Goals</strong>: It’s easy to set goals while listening to the people we want to
						serve. We look to the intersection between what we do and what they need.</li>
					<li><strong>Cohesion check</strong>: Now is a great time to look at ourselves for cohesion. Are we
						holding doors open and closed at the same time? Are there parts of our work that seem like
						non-functional extra appendages, waving at no-one in the wind?</li>
					<li><strong>Timelines</strong>: No one respects an arbitrary deadline. Luckily, there is always some
						natural human urgency to fixing broken things and actualizing the vision in our minds. </li>
					<li><strong>Success criteria for experiments</strong>: we should be able to clearly describe what we
						are aiming to do (without reducing our vision to a single metric, which tends to squish and
						destroy everything)</li>
					<li><strong>Building our experimentation team</strong>: If our experiments aim to serve specific
						groups of people, we collaborate and consult with them throughout the entire process. There’s no
						other way. Speculative empathy is garbage.</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-garbage.png" alt="Drawing of a garbage can" class="image">


				<h2>Generating & strengthening ideas</h2>
				<p>If we have worked through the questions above, we will have some intuitions bubbling up. We may even
					find that our heads are about to explode with delightful squirming ideas. Yes? It’s time to design a
					strategy for creative experimentation! </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Find inspiration:</strong> For design inspiration, we can immerse ourselves in the
						feelings people want to feel, the reasons people come to us, the barriers people face, and what
						we want people to feel. Our ideas for experiments can unclog blocked parts of the experience,
						broaden tight spots, hem unravelling places, bridge gaps, bring clarity, build new paths, and
						make experiences more useful, connecting, and joyful for people.</li>
					<li><strong>Be open to ideas:</strong> It’s best to create a very long list of experiments, the
						silly, the strange, the shocking, the plagiarized, the boring, the redundant: all welcome.
						Create an emotionally open and non-judgemental space, document everything. </li>
					<li><strong>Look around:</strong> Consider other organizations and groups who have faced similar
						challenges: how did they do it? Most transformative ideas aren’t new: they can easily be traced
						from one field to another, or are new combinations of existing ideas. </li>
					<li><strong>Choosing ideas</strong>: Prioritize relevant experiments which transform a barrier or
						serve an unmet need for the people we are prioritizing. Some of these experiments can serve
						unmet needs in obvious ways, and some can be more intuitive, wild, and playful.</li>
					<li><strong>Playtest ideas</strong>: Build out a sketch or prototype and play them out.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One of the magical things about designing experiences is that it can honour the people as people with
					choices, wandering around in an open world. We design experiments that simply invite people in
					particular directions, particular spaces or particular
					interactions. </p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ed-openworld.png"
					alt="Drawing of a dinosaur creature surrounded by swirls and arrows" class="image">

				<h2>Implementation & Feedback</h2>
				<p>Finally, we begin implementation. We execute our experiments and have the joy of watching them
					unfold. </p>
				<p>Some experiments will succeed, some will fail, and some will have some unexpected results. Sometimes
					we may fail to understand the difference between the three. Don’t worry though, the people we are
					designing with (and for) will be
					able to understand the difference. </p>
				<p>Documentation and on-site listening are critical for later review. Each experiment is a space for
					learning more about the people we are working with and about the act of designing experiences
					itself. And as soon as we begin to implement our experiments
					we begin our research again: listening, watching, and working to understand.</p>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>We each start our lives with some DNA and circumstances, and as far as anyone knows, the rest of who
					we are is shaped by the experiences in our lives. We can’t take our experiences lightly.</p>

				<p>I design experiences for people. </p>
				<p>I do this because of a lifetime of interminable waiting rooms, bureaucratic mazes, sales funnels, and
					other deadening substitutes for a meaningful existence. <strong>We deserve better. We are all
						capable of better.</strong></p>
				<p>I work with interactions, motivations, affordances, barriers, and flow. I work for and with people,
					working with identities and communities that intersect and overlap in complex ways. </p>
				<p>I listen, watch, and gather information on the way people experience things. I invest time in
					considering the ways people and their environments are interacting. I design and experiment with
					tiny side-quests and adventures. And I facilitate an ongoing
					process where the needs of people inform the shape of the experience, event, product, or space. </p>
				<p>There are some things that I don’t do. I don’t try to control the experience of people. I don’t push
					diverse people towards a rigidly defined experience. And I don’t work without consent.</p>
				<p>My work isn’t aggressively transformational, at least not in a magic-wand kind of way. My work
					doesn’t take a mediocre or bad situation and use a touch of sparkle dust to make it good. It’s an
					ongoing practise, a continuous commitment
					to paying attention, a slow transformation towards better experiences.</p>
