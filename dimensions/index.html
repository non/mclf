        <h1>Exploring Design Dimensions in Online Spaces <br><span class="subtitle"></span></h1>

        <p>A year ago, when the pandemic pulled us all online, I made a <a target="_blank"
            href="https://marieflanagan.com/video-tools/">list of video meeting tools</a>. I later made a <a
            target="_blank" href="https://marieflanagan.com/online-hangs/">list of more experimental spaces </a>for
          connecting online, hosted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEcKO0pgrF9/">meetups</a> where
          we toured around online spaces, and even shared online spaces on the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://twitter.com/TheCurrentCBC/status/1346808197554823168?s=20/">morning news.</a></p>
        <p>In this work, I've noticed at least 19 fascinating design decisions or <span class="italic">dimensions</span>
          in online spaces. Some of these dimensions also apply to offline events, some relate to time, space, or
          access, some are a bit wriggly and defy easy categorization (my favourites). These are not binary oppositions,
          they are more like spectrums of possibility.</p>

        <p>I'm not really sure why I wrote this. I hate when people divide things into categories, it always seems so
          imprecise and intellectually violent, but somehow I find myself doing the same. I think the categorisation is
          - for me - an excuse to more deeply burrow into interesting questions about the ways people come together, the
          relationships between architecture and connection, and the spaces between us. </p>

            <h2>Dimensions of Online Spaces</h2>
            <p>Time</p>

            <h3 id="scsp">Scheduled <<<>>>> Spontaneous</h3>

            <!-- <p class="italic">Or are events scheduled at specific times? Or can you drop in whenever you are free?</p> -->

            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Scheduled Spaces</span> are designed for gatherings with a clear starting time. Example: <a target="_blank"
                  href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Jitsi</a>, a video-call platform that you could use
                to host a weekly reading group, work meeting, or performance.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Spontaneous Spaces</span> are designed for spur-of-the-moment connections,
                allowing you to
                show
                up at any time. Example: <a target="_blank" href="https://chatroulette.com/">Chatroulette (nsfw)</a>
                is designed for you to connect with people
                on a whim.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's growing tension between event organizers who prefer scheduling
              gatherings and over-committed attendees who want to spontaneously assess their energy
              in real time. Some events are always better scheduled: no-one prefers waiting three hours on hold over a
              scheduled phone call. But people also crave informal 'drop-in' online community spaces that resemble
              offline spaces, like libraries, cafes, and pubs. Spontaneous Spaces allow for social connection without
              the burden of planning an interaction, and perhaps most interestingly, for chance and serendipitous
              connection.</p>

            <p>Scheduled gatherings are useful when coordinating complicated schedules, planning detailed events, and
              minimizing
              security problems. Spontaneous online spaces are useful for managing your social energy responsively and
              deciding
              moment-to-moment what you have the energy and capacity to do.</p>

            <h3 id="syas">Synchronous <<<>>>> Asynchronous</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Synchronous Spaces</span> simply require people to be online together at the same
                time. They are always real-time, or as close to real-time as the
                technology and the human brain allows. Example: <a target="_blank"
                  href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a> allows people to talk over a video call with each
                other at the same time.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Asynchronous Spaces</span> are designed for people to be online or communicating
                at
                different times. A good
                example is email where you can have a conversation over hours, days, or even years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The difference between synchronous and asynchonous spaces seems to be a matter of speed.
              We are not inside eachother's heads, communication is inherently riddled with pauses and gaps. But big
              gaps are
              very different than small gaps, as anyone who has ever sat through an uncomfortable silence knows. There
              are tricks to making asynchronous communication feel more synchronous, like the animated "..." you
              might see when someone is typing.
            <p>I'm also deeply curious about the effects of <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backchannel_(linguistics)">backchannels</a> on synchronous
              communication. These tiny, near-constant pieces of feedback can help align (sync!) the feelings and
              thoughts of people, but this seems
              more superficial than the slow, vulnerable, and contextless emotional alignment
              of people communicating asynchronously. </p>
            <p>Synchronous spaces are effective for generating social energy, dynamic connection, and quick
              feedback. If you are confused by something, you can type a question, or even just squint your eyes, and
              the speaker may know to stop and explain. Asynchronous spaces allow for more control over how you process
              and communicate your emotions. They are more like the online version of writing letters, buffering
              experiences and communication through time and space. </p>

            <h3 id="tepe">Temporary <<<>>>> Permanent</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Temporary Spaces</span> delete or hide content after a certain amount of time. An
                example
                is
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a>, where posts disappear after 24 hours.
                Another example is <a target="_blank" href="https://pad.riseup.net/">Riseup Pad</a>, where the shared
                document is deleted after a predetermined period of inactivity.
              </li>
              <li><span class="strong">Permanent Spaces</span> keep content up forever. An example of this is a message
                board,
                where posts are visible for decades, as long as someone pays the server fees.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>There are many different forms of permanence. Our current tactics for persisting knowledge are very
              much like books: think, write, print, transmit. Our language is changing constantly, and an emoji or
              phrase can easily take on new meaning while your use of it five years ago is crystalized permanently. Oral
              traditions, in contrast, allow for a kind of permanence that carries the content through thousands of
              years by allowing the form to change as needed with the shape of the storyteller.
            </p>

            <p>Spaces with permanent content can help people share knowledge across time and space. A message board for
              a specific illness allows people to surface shared experiences and resources, even if they live decades
              and continents apart. Temporary spaces have a very different advantage: they relieve pressure from the
              ever-present anxiety of social surveillance and the permanence of the internet. Even though we know that
              anything on the internet is surveilled, tracked, and stored somewhere, it is a relief knowing that it is
              not easily accessible to anyone with a search engine. Temporary spaces also offer relief from the modern
              predicament of an overwhelming deluge of content. We
              are limited beings, with limited attention and limited time, and we are drowning in limitless content.
              Temporary spaces save us from the feeling of "I'll look at it later" by making that impossible.
              Ironically, temporary spaces also seem to create more content than previously imaginable.</p>
            <h3 id="cededi">Centralized <<<>>>> Decentralized</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Centralized Spaces</span> are designed so everyone is connected to a central hub
                or owner. An example of a centralized online space is a personal <a target="_blank"
                  href="LIhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsletterNK">Newsletter</a>. The person writing the newsletter
                has access to all the recipients and total control over what is written and sent, if you are a recipient
                you have no relationship with other recipients or control over what is sent.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Decentralized Spaces</span> have multiple hubs or owners. No single person has
                control over the platform or the relationships between people. Example: <a target="_blank"
                  href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, an open-source social media platform where many people
                run self-hosted social networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One way to think about this dimension is in terms of the actual servers that host the space. If one
              individual wanted to close down the platform, could they? Another way to think about this dimension is in
              terms of implementation, or social organization. Most online spaces are centralized spaces, in that all
              decisions relating to the spaces are made by a single company or individual. But socially these spaces can
              feel decentralized. Example: many different people (anyone really) can create and moderate their own
              Facebook group or subreddit.
            </p>
            <p>Centralization is generally disempowering (unless you are at the center) and seems to always perch on top
              of exploitation. Decentralization is better for more people but seems to fall short as well. There always
              seems to be a lot of glossing over who has the power and knowledge and resources to run one of these
              smaller hubs. I had hoped that Distributed Spaces, where everyone shares ownership of the space could be a
              third option, but it's still unclear to me. I have more to learn here.
            </p>
            <p>Centralized spaces are easier to control and have smoother consistency of experience. They are relatively
              easy to build and maintain, since everything goes back to a single source. Centralized spaces are ideal if
              you are aiming to hoard wealth or exert extreme control. Decentralized spaces are more flexible and more
              generally resilient. If one part goes down, the rest can stay up. Decentralized spaces allow people to
              have more agency over their own environment, resulting in greater diversity.
            </p>
            <h3 id="pucupr">Public <<<>>>> Community <<<>>> Private</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Public Spaces</span> are designed for connections between strangers. An example
                is <a target="_blank" href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, an app that matches you with a random
                stranger
                over the phone to discuss a specific topic.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Community Spaces</span> are designed to connect you with broader community
                circles, whether they are friends of friends or interest-based communities. One example is on Facebook
                Groups, where people connect over shared interests in smaller groups.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Private Spaces</span> are designed specifically for connection with friends,
                and family. Examples of private spaces are a <a target="_blank" href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>
                group chat, or the friends-only social
                network, <a target="_blank" href="https://cocoon.com/">Cocoon</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Totally public spaces are thrilling, there's a feeling that you can connect with anyone. They also tap
              into people's desires to see and be seen. Private spaces are more intimate, assuming shared context and
              feeling like an extension of the home. Most online spaces are somewhere between these two, making space
              for interacting with friends-of-friends or people with shared interests. </p>
            <p>Community spaces often allow for the adventure of connecting with strangers, with the safety rail of a
              shared contact or shared community. </p>

            <h3 id="spfl">Spatial <<<>>>> Flat</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Spatial Spaces</span> use the idea of "space" as a design element. Example:
                <a target="_blank" href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>, a space where your avatar can wander around
                and interact with others.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Flat Spaces</span> present all participants identically. Example: <a
                  target="_blank" href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>, when you see every participant in the
                video call in identical boxes, and hear all participants equally.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Spatial Spaces often have "rooms" or "maps." They may include visual spatiality, like an avatar wandering
              into a virtual kitchen to have tea. They often have audio spatiality, so your avatar can wander closer to
              people to hear them talking. </p>
            <p>Spatial Spaces allow for complex architectures in the space. In physical space, you would have very
              different conversations on the sidewalk than you would in your kitchen, or in a public bathroom. Most
              online spaces are designed without accounting for these spatial differences, everyone is just dumped into
              a grid or an open page.</p>
            <h3 id="tevovi">Text <<<>>>> Voice <<<>>>> Video</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Text-only Spaces</span> are designed to be used only with written text. An
                example is <a target="_blank" href="https://midnight.pub/">Midnight Pub</a>, a virtual pub that lets you
                write posts and create pages.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Voice-first Spaces</span> are designed for people to communicate using their
                voices. An interesting
                example is <a target="_blank" href="https://cozyroom.xyz/">Cozy Room</a>, where you are represented by
                an avatar and you see their mouth moving as you speak.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Video Spaces</span> are designed for video communication. Some spaces might only
                allow
                others to see you, like Twitch or YouTube. Some spaces might allow everyone to see everyone, like any
                video
                call. The far extreme of video connection would be a body-rigged live-cam VR hangout.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Text-only spaces have the lowest environmental impact, and can be accessible to people with low internet
              connections. Voice-first spaces are ideal for fostering intimacy, tone of voice carries so much extra
              context. Voice also allows for vocal <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backchannel_(linguistics)">backchannels</a>. Video spaces are ideal
              for people who want to communicate visually or with body language. </p>
            <p>Audio can feel even more intimate than video. Written words can be interpreted in many different ways,
              and tone of voice carries more information and can be clearer. Audio spaces can be a relief for people
              with video-call burnout, exhausted with policing their bodies to show up in particular ways.</p>

            <h3 id="stsa">Structured <<<>>>> Sandbox</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Structured Spaces</span> have strict pre-designed structure with very little
                intentional creative freedom. Example: <a target="_blank" href="https://meet.google.com/">Google
                  Meet</a> which has very few features and a strict structure.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Sandbox Spaces</span> are created as you go, sometimes offering creative tools
                but
                mostly relying on participants to create meaning. A good example is <a target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> where people can build and explore the environment.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Facilitated spaces that have specific rules around engagement can really transform how you feel about the
              space. </p>

            <h3 id="amdi">Ambient <<<>>>> Direct</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Ambient Spaces</span> are generally used for passive copresence. Example: <a
                  target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate</a>, a site where you can sign up to work
                in silence with a stranger.
              </li>
              <li><span class="strong">Direct Spaces</span> are spaces that require full attention and interaction with
                others. Example: a traditional video call on <a target="_blank" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ambient spaces can provide feelings of connection and community without asking much of participants. Like
              spontaneous spaces, they allow for more flexibility and responsiveness to meet the needs of people.
              Ambient spaces allow people to be co-present and engage in parallel play. They have the feeling of
              long-haul truckers driving with the CB radio on, or the long silences of a road trip.</p>
            <p>Direct spaces are better for focussed connection between smaller groups, and are nearly always also
              designed for scheduled gatherings. There is magic to focussed spaces, like poetry readings, conversation
              groups, or birthday parties. It's not just that you are together, it's that you know that everyone is
              paying attention to the same thing. </p>
            <p>An in-between for this dimension is something like Club Quarantine, a Zoom dance party where everyone
              dances alone at home but different dancers are given the "spotlight" for a few moments at a time. </p>

            <h3 id="usre">Used-As-Intended <<<>>>> Repurposed</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Used-As-Intended Spaces</span> are used more or less for their designed purpose.
                Of
                course, design often shifts with use, so this is a bit flexible. A good example is Twitter: designed for
                microblogging, and used more or less for this purpose.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Repurposed Spaces</span> are spaces designed for a specific use that are
                repurposed
                for
                other kinds of use. A good example of this is Google Spreadsheet Parties.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="coco">Collaborative <<<>>>> Competitive</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Collaborative Spaces</span> are designed for many people to contribute, often in
                interactive and cumulative ways. Examples include fanfic communities or collaborative whiteboards for
                online
                drawing.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Competitive Spaces</span> encourage competition by design. Example: most
                online
                games are competitive spaces.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="crco">Creation <<<>>>> Consumption</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Creation Spaces</span> inherently invite you to actively contribute creatively to
                the
                space. This might be drawing, music, dance, writing, or even creating the environment.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Consumption Spaces</span>, in the most absolute sense, don’t belong on this list,
                because they aren’t really spaces for connecting with other people online. But many spaces invite you to
                consume more than create while simultaneously allowing for interactivity. An example for this is a
                Twitch
                Stream or a Netflix party.</li>
              <p>We feel differently when sending vs receiving.</p>
              <p>Artistic media might be different than communication tech.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3 id="moun">Moderated <<<>>>> Unmoderated</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Structured Spaces</span> have a set of rules that are enforced by special users.
                If
                you
                break the rules you are penalized or kicked out. Some spaces are community moderated, where anyone is
                able
                to kick anyone out, or users are kicked out by vote. Example: that drawing game where you vote to
                remove
                someone.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Sandbox Spaces</span> have no rules. Of course, all spaces have unspoken rules
                and
                power structures, so unmoderated spaces can be understood as secretly moderated spaces (Tyranny of
                structurelessness). Unmoderated spaces can be useful when you are curious about the state of the
                community,
                they communicate a lot about who is present.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="cuop">Curated <<<>>>> Open</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Curated Spaces</span> only allow for certain kinds of content. Usually there are
                single
                figureheads or tight groups of people who define and decide what is welcome in the space. These spaces
                tend
                to foster passionate communities.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Open Spaces</span> are open to any kind of content you want to throw at them.
                Because
                of the lack of cohesiveness, they often have many people coming and going.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="acin">Accessibled <<<>>>> Inaccessible</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Accessible Spaces</span> are spaces that people can access. Of course, there is
                no
                space that all people can access, so like all the other dimensions, this is a spectrum. More accessible
                spaces might take into account features like captions, read-aloud text, support for different languages,
                platforms that work with low-internet, simple and no-flashing visuals, flexibility around camera use,
                and
                space for people to show up as they are and be welcomed.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Inaccessible Spaces</span> are spaces that block access. Often this involves
                expecting
                people to use the platform in a rigid way, making no allowances for differences in experiences and
                environments. Questions around inaccessibility might start with: who has access? Who doesn’t have
                access?
                Who has partial access? Why?</li>
              <p>Built with people who have specific needs, not for them.</p>
              <p>Reminder that you are in your physcial body</p>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="prda">Privacy-first <<<>>>> Data-Selling</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Data-Selling spaces</span> generally exist to collect and sell your data and
                social
                graphs to advertisers. An excellent example of this is Facebook. This is worth mentioning because it’s
                often
                the financial model of connecting spaces.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Privacy-first</span> only collect data with your informed consent, and only uses
                this
                to make the experience better for you. Example: inviting you to share your location to match you
                with
                other local stamp collectors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="hude">Humanizing <<<>>>> Dehumanizing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Humanizing Spaces</span> flatten people into “other” or simple representations.
              </li>
              <li><span class="strong">Dehumanizing Spaces</span> invite complexity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="anpeon">Anonymous <<<>>>> Persistent Identity <<<>>>> Onymous</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Anonymous Spaces</span> allow you to participate without identifying yourself to
                other
                participants (you are never completely anonymous online). Example: an online text editor that allows
                you
                to collaboratively write a story with friends without knowing who wrote which part. Anonymous spaces can
                be
                enormously liberating, especially if you feel pressure to behave in a certain way.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Persistent Identity Spaces</span> are on the other end of the spectrum, forcing
                you
                to
                verify and publish your username with a passport. Sometimes this is necessary for legal reasons. They
                often
                exclude people who don’t have documentation or have a different name than the documentation.</li>
              <li><span class="strong">Onymous Spaces</span> allow you to create a name of your choice, but encourage
                you
                to
                use only that name, designing for a singular persistent identity. Persistent usernames can increase
                accountability and allow for richer relationships.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="coal">Connecting <<<>>>> Alienating</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="strong">Connecting Spaces</span> are </li>
              <li><span class="strong">Alienating Spaces</span> are </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Obviously no one wants to make an alienating space for connecting online. But many people do.</p>
            <p>The uncanny valley of connection, feeling like you are almost connecting but not quite.</p>

            <h3>Last Thoughts</h3>
            <p>There have been platforms for connecting online since the beginning of the internet. The internet itself
              is a
              platform for connecting. But since the first wave of COVID we’ve seen a massive emergence of online spaces
              and
              experimentation with how people connect online. It’s strange that the social media giants didn’t leap into
              this opportunity and shoulder everyone else out of the way. They are perfectly positioned, and already
              have
              hooks in most of us. But I’m delighted that they didn’t.</p>
            <p>Lately I’ve been thinking about how these different platforms vary. About how online spaces shape our
              connections, and how we might reimagine what online spaces could be. </p>
            <p>Now I’m done here I’m going to the park.</p>
