        <h2>What does it mean to build trust in play?</h2>

        <p>
          Common is an experimental video game for communities. It came out of a deep curiousity around decentralized
          networks of care and community trust.</p>


        <p>I made Common for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cafka.org/page/about">CAFKA,</a> a contemporary art
          festival. Common was played by hundreds of people in the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and
          Cambridge over a month.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-layers.png" alt="common layers" class="wide-image image">


        <p>Common isn't the prettiest game I've worked on (that would be <a
            href="https://marieflanagan.com/soft-sanctuary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soft
            Sanctuary</a> or <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/mood-ring/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Mood Ring</a>) or the most fun
          game I've ever worked on (that would be <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/closer/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>). But it's my favourite game, it's the most experimental and
          ambitious, and it's the closest I've ever come to making a game that might expand what people imagine is
          possible.</p>



        <h2>How Common works</h2>
        <p>Common begins with a single player shining brightly in a vast nothingness. The player's life-force
          immediately begins decreasing, and they start to fade. </p>

        <h2>How to join Common</h2>

        <p>The only way a player can join Common is by meeting up with an existing player face-to-face. Both players
          must hold down the connective buttons at the same time until a connection is formed.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-connecting.png" alt="connecting people" class="wide-image image">

        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>Once invited, a player can play online.</p>

        <p>The player must caretake their connections. They can do this by sending life-force to connected players. This
          simple act
          increases the life-force
          of each player, of the connection between them, and of their larger network.</p>

        <p>The player can also invite new players. Larger networks have the potential to provide more life-force for
          everyone, but they also mean more caretaking work.</p>

        <h3>The challenge</h3>
        <p>In Common, there is an environmental force deteriorating the life-force and connections of all players. If
          players stop
          reinforcing their connections, the connections decay and eventually split. Big groups break into smaller ones,
          and if nothing is done, an untethered player will eventually float out into the void alone. </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Reaching different communities</h2>

        <!-- <p>I was player one, the first player in the network.</p> -->
        <p>I wanted to make sure that anyone who was curious would have an opportunity to join, even if they didn't know
          anyone currently playing. So I hung out in different public spaces for the entire month so anyone could
          come and find me and join the game.</p>

        <h2>What is interesting about Common?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Common is a game for communities: </strong>It's more than a multiplayer game, it's an exploration
            of decentralized
            networks of care and community trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Common is player-shaped and player-driven: </strong>The entirety of Common is shaped by the
            collective and individual decisions of the
            players.</li>

          <li><strong>Common is a simulation: </strong>It is a game, but it's also an interactive simulation, an
            invitation for people to imagine different ways of coming together.</li>
          <li><strong>Common doesn't prioritize fun:</strong> Common invites a kind of playfulness, but it doesn't
            prioritize
            fun, at least in the traditional sense of the word. It was designed to invite a specific kind
            of community connection. </li>
          <li><strong>There are no enemies or death in Common:</strong> The only enemy is the slow decay brought on by
            time.</li>
          <li><strong>You need to meet someone in person to join Common:</strong> The mandatory physical connection
            means that each player has some kind of personal connection to at least one other player.</li>
          <li><strong>Players can carry each other in Common:</strong> Either person in a single connection can do the
            work of
            maintaining the connection, and the connection will last. The effort of the individual isn't important,
            what matters is the state of the relationship, no matter who did the work.</li>
          <li><strong>Common is won collectively:</strong> A player's health is determined by the health of their
            relationships.
            The score/status is assigned to a player's entire network, incentivizing people
            to work in the interests of the whole group.</li>

        </ul>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-play.png" alt="play screen" class="wide-image image">

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>Common is an exploration of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shared experience as a political act</li>
          <li>Community trust as something that is built through attention, care, and stewardship</li>
          <li>Communities as living entities, requiring continuous investment</li>
          <!-- <li>Current anxieties around trust as expressed through blockchain technologies and decentralization</li> -->
          <!-- <li>The relationship between individualism, transparency, surveillance, collaboration, and trust</li> -->
          <!-- <li>Attention and care as intrinsically valuable labour</li> -->
        </ul>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-kids.png" alt="children playing Common" class="wide-image image">
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Common began with a series of questions, that eventually became a very long list. I've included some of them
          below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>what is trust?</li>
          <li>Is trust a choice? An action? A state?</li>
          <li>what is trust in the context of a community?</li>
          <li>can a community co-steward resources? Or is the tragedy of the commons an inevitability?</li>
          <li>What is the relationship between vulnerability and trust?</li>
          <li>What is betrayal? Is betrayal related to trust?</li>
          <li>What does trust have to do with the idea of private property?</li>
          <li>who is accountable for our shared environment?</li>
          <li>Who owns the underlying platforms of our realities? Who is accountable to these underlying platforms? Who
            stewards them?</li>
          <li>Is the tragedy of the Commons something that really happens? Is it inevitable?</li>
          <li>What is the relationship between distrust and &ldquo;the individual actor&rdquo;?</li>
          <li>What is the difference between individual trust transactions and communal trust networks?</li>
          <li>Why does most game theory seem to gloss over the most interesting parts of trust (holistically what is
            it, how do we grow it) in favour of the least interesting part (who acts, who &ldquo;wins&rdquo;)?</li>
          <li>What is the relationship between trust and control?</li>
          <li>Attention as labour, attention as value, attention as commodified labour?</li>
          <li>Do communities require continuous investment?</li>
        </ul>

          <p>For early prototyping I used everything from beans and string to coins and pens.</p>

          <img src="../img/blog-images/co-proto.png" alt="pens and coins making a network" class="wide-image image">


        <h2>Process:</h2>
        <p>Common took nine leisurely months to design (I had other simultaneous projects), 90 agonizing days to build,
          and 30 magical days to play.</p>

        <p>Early iterations of Common were playtested with beans and string and large groups of patient playtesters.</p>
        <p>While researching I explored many fields: from historical interpretations of trust and "faith", to deep
          dives
          into
          decentralized organizing practices, to Game Theory. I even participated in a blockchain hackathon at the
          World
          Crypto Economic Forum when I was exploring decentralization.</p>

          each screen that a player might see) or game components (where I list the proporties of different game
          elements) you can poke around in <a

        <h2>What worked well with Common?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Common was a direct realization of my original vision: </strong> It worked! I made what I wanted
            to make,
            which was delightful and surprising given how ambitious it was.</li>
          <li><strong>Players understood how to play Common: </strong>A danger with experimental games is that people
            won't understand how to play them, but in this case, people of all ages and many different backgrounds
            understood how to play quickly and easily.</li>
          <li><strong>Playtesting worked wonders:</strong> Common was playtested early and often throughout the process.
            My playtesters were varied, including people who love games, people who don't play games, and other game
            designers. I received invaluable feedback from the testers.</li>
          <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Working with mentors amplified my ability by at least x3.</li>
          <li><strong>Common had no major bugs:</strong> Certainly, there were small bugs, but there were no major
            incidents, which was amazing for my first real-time multiplayer, city-wide game that needed to run for an
            entire month.</li>
          <li><strong>The huge diversity of players:</strong> Because of my journey around the cities over the month and
            a
            huge number of supportive partners, I had a wide variety of players, everyone from researchers at the
            Institute for Quantum Computing to children at a city library.</li>
          <li><strong>The player response was delightful</strong> Some players were delighted, describing it as "unlike
            anything else they'd ever
            played." Other players were mystified and curious, describing it as "not really a game" which I usually
            interpret as praise if they like it anyway.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Lessons</h2>

        <p>Common was the most conceptually, creatively, and technically challenging project I have ever worked on.
          There are several things I'd do differently if I could start again.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>More polish:</strong> Common could have used more visual polish. I didn't get to the visual polish
            stage in time, and the game has an underwhelming aesthetic.</li>
          <li><strong>More weight on engagement:</strong> I wanted it to be a slow, low-stress, community
            experience, but I also wanted to keep people engaged. If I were to start again, I'd move the balance
            slightly more towards engagement.</li>

          <li><strong>Less time paper prototyping: </strong>For this specific project, I'd spend less time with
            paper/physical prototyping, and
            jump into making a code prototype faster. It wasn't very useful to prototype
            with string and beans because this is a game about invisible connections and relations.</li>
          <li><strong>Engaging with the general public every day for a month was a lot:</strong> In the future, I'd
            look for more helpers with public outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> In early research, I wanted to build Common on a blockchain because Common is
            an exploration of *decentralized* community care. I spent a lot of time and energy learning how to make
            apps on the Etherium blockchain before deciding that it wasn't the right choice for Common. I wish I had
            realized this sooner.</li>
          <li><strong>Better framing of expectations:</strong> I didn't design Common with fun as the priority, but it's
            still hard
            when people keep waiting for adrenaline and action because of the word "game".</li>
          <li><strong>Paid developer help: </strong>I'd hire a developer that I could collaborate
            with, freeing up more of my time for design. For a project this
            ambitious it was too much work to do it all myself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Community and Collaborators</h2>

        <h3>Mentorship</h3>
        <p>Common was the first game where I actively sought out mentors. <a
            href="https://twitter.com/theophani?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiffany Conroy</a>
          mentored me on everything related to the
          frontend
          development, <a href="https://isthisa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Friend</a> talked
          me through decentralized networks, and<a href="http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"> Eir&iacute;kr
            &Aring;sheim</a> and <a href="https://aaronlevin.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron
            Levin</a>
          helped me with a lot of the backend development.</p>
        <p>The help of these incredible engineers and professionals made it possible to make a huge project in a short
          amount of time. One notable takeaway from the mentorship was learning how differently my mentors approached
          debugging and problem-solving.</p>

        <h3>Curatorial Relationship</h3>
        <p>Common was the first project where I was working with an active and deeply involved curator. Gordon Hatt
          came
          to Berlin to meet with me and discuss the conceptual design and continued to be involved throughout the
          design process. He
          also served as an intermediary between myself and the board of the festival, who also had input and
          questions
          about the project. It was helpful to have someone who was equally invested in the project, but bridging the
          gap between
          contemporary art and experimental videos was sometimes a challenge.</p>

        <h3>Collaborator and testers</h3>
        <p>My projects always involve a large number of formal and informal research conversations as well as large
          numbers
          of
          playtesters. I like to keep a list of everyone who has contributed, to honour their contributions and also
          remind myself of the communities that shape my work.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          Common explores the nature of community trust through play. For an entire month, anyone in the city of
          Kitchener-Waterloo could join the virtual game but only by connecting with someone in person. At its core,
          Common was an experiential game that helped a city reimagine connection and community trust. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My process to create Common involved research, prototyping, and real-time co-creation with the general public
          in a city. At a high level, my process with Common involved extensive discovery research, multiple design
          rounds resulting in prototypes, a collaborative development cycle where we brought the ideas from prototypes to code;
          and a deployment where we launched Common as part of an arts festival and co-created the experience
          with participants. When the game ended, I sent each participant a thank you email with a sped-up relapse of the entire game, so they could see what they had helped to build.
        </p>

        <p>
          My key insight from Common is that community trust is built by people showing up for each other repeatedly
          over time. Also, the unsurprising lesson that trust is harder to demonstrate and build online. Common was an
          ambitious, time-bounded exploration of trust. The lessons I learned from Common continue to shape my design
          practices today.
