        <h1>Come With Me</h1>


        <!-- <img src="../img/blog-images/oh-onlineHangs.png" alt="drawing of people on laptops" class="wide-image image"> -->
        <p> I am researching and prototyping “ComeWithMe” a vibrant, immersive installation that explores the spaces
          between people. ComeWithMe translates the physical, “real world” movements and gestures of people into a
          virtual world of animated sculptural shapes and flowing, colourful ropes. Using a camera, projectors, and
          immersive sound, ComeWithMe is a soft world where people can explore attention, connection, and care together
          through physical movements.
        </p>
        <p>My art examines the spaces between people: how we reach for each other, how we connect, and how we sometimes
          fail to connect and care for each other. As a neurodivergent artist, I have struggled my entire life with
          connection and community. Despite deep and resolute efforts, I am always disconnected, slightly out of sync,
          and out of rhythm with the people around me. My art practice is deeply tied to my struggle and exploration of
          what it means to connect, cooperate, and truly feel a sense of belonging in the presence of others.
        </p>
        <p>Over the last 20 years, I have watched the rise of social media giants, and seen the act of becoming a
          “friend” or “connecting” with someone reduced to a click of a button. These days, we are relentlessly and
          completely connected to one another through technology. Underlying this superficial connection is a growing
          loneliness. The tech giants have made connection difficult for all of us. ComeWithMe challenges and invites
          people to dig deeper than pervasive superficial relations. Instead, it invites us to explore kinesthetic and
          bodily modes of relation, stewardship, and care. At its core, ComeWithMe is an embodied space for people to
          find resonance and connection as we try to balance mutual care for each other with the demands of our world.
        </p>
        <h2>Prototype
        </h2>
        <p>ComeWithMe is a playful, immersive, installation that will be projected onto two adjoining walls in the
          installation area, creating a visual sense of immersion. A special LiDAR depth-sensing camera will monitor the
          installation area for people. Speakers will be arranged around the installation area, creating a spatial
          soundscape.
        </p>
        <p>Without participants, ComeWithMe is a lonely world, with soft purple lighting, subtle organic plant-like
          shapes, and soft, deeply reverberating music.
        </p>
        <p>When participants enter the installation area, ComeWithMe comes to life. Each participant in the installation
          area is represented on the screen by a vibrant, organic, humanoid “character” that moves its limbs as the
          participant does, and floats around the immersive world, like a virtual avatar.
        </p>
        <p>As the characters reach for things in the virtual world, flowing ropes emerge from their hands. If two
          participants reach for each other, they become connected by flowing strands of multicoloured rope and matching
          melodic waves of ambient sound.
        </p>

        <p>Participants will try to build these connections (flowing digital ropes) by reaching for each other. Larger
          groups can form or people can pair into smaller groups. By mutually and repeatedly reaching for each other,
          participants can strengthen connections, which will otherwise visibly and audibly decay over time. The decay
          will be slow and gently rhythmic, inviting gentle dance-like motion from the participants.
        </p>
        <p>Two kinds of small sculptural objects float past the participants periodically: some sharp and bright, some
          rounded and pulsing. Participants will avoid the sharp objects as these will sever connections and temporarily
          remove all colours from a cluster. Participants will reach for the rounded, pulsing objects as they create
          delightful washes of colour and sounds.
        </p>
        <p>An ambient, sonically immersive soundscape will provide a subtly shifting audio backdrop as connections form
          and decay.
        </p>
        <p>Each participant group will bring its own relational presence to ComeWithMe, no two encounters will be the
          same because, at its core, it explores the space between specific people in a specific moment in time. I see
          this space as a space of incredible possibility. How does it work? How can it be activated? What happens when
          a whole network of these spaces becomes active? What changes occur outside of and within us when we feel
          connected with the people around us?
        </p>
        <p>My aim is to use my current vision for ComeWithMe as a scaffold and playground for research into connection
          while experimenting with the myriad of technologies and tools at the Metalab. The project may shift
          drastically as I experiment, take risks, and learn. The project is supported by a 6-month artist residency at
          the Metalab, the research and development lab at the Society for Arts and Technology [SAT]. The Metalab is
          actively conducting world-class research related to immersion, computer vision, and spatialized sound. I will
          use equipment already available at the Metalab including projectors, audio speakers for spatialized sound, and
          a webcam for tracking participants.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
        <p>I am using LivePose, an open-source Computer Vision command-line tool created by Metalab that will allow me
          to identify and track the moments of the participants. I’m using Unity, a Game Engine for the creation of
          immersive 3D worlds, Blender to sculpt the characters and shapes, and Ableton to create the music.
        </p>
