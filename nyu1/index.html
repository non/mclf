				<h1>The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Day One - Why am I here?</span></h1>
				<p>Well I&rsquo;m here. Alone in New York City. Being paid to make art.</p>
				<p>I feel like my chest is expanding, I&rsquo;m breathing in and I might breathe in the entire world.
					Something is coming. I feel it coming on, coming from within and totally unstoppable. It&rsquo;s
					been a strange year.</p>

				<p>It's the first day of my residency at <a target="_blank" href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/"> NYU's
						Game Center</a> and I'm ruminating on why I make games even though I don't like playing games.
				</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ny-lungs.png" alt="Drawing of lungs" class="image">
				<p>I know how precious it is, my spot here. How a long list of things outside my control colluded with a
					few things inside my control to open a door somewhere. Inside that door someone did me a kindness.
				</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ny-chair.png" alt="Drawing of an office chair" class="image">
				<p> Now I sit in this chair. I want to look at this moment plainly. My entitlement is insidious,
					creeping in through insecurity and ignorance and guiding me around like an invisible handler.</p>
				<p>Today was the first day of my residency. At the orientation each new undergraduate named the last
					game they played, and people murmured appreciatively or cheered. I had never heard of most of the
					games. I kept hoping that one person would say something like &ldquo;make-believe&rdquo; or talk
					about a jumping game they played on their walk to school.</p>
				<p>I don&rsquo;t really play games. Well, I play them, but not for fun. Playing games is research, it's
					work. I find tiny spots of joy in games: a mechanic that satisfies some deep bone-itch, a thrill, an
					analogous catharsis. But games don&rsquo;t draw me in. I&rsquo;m not thrilled and racing towards
					games, breathless with hot blood rushing in my ears.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m holding them in my hands delicately, like puzzle boxes from another planet.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/ny-puzzlebox.png" alt="Drawing of an office chair" class="image">

				<p>Here are a few things I run into when I try to play games for fun:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Competition, a key driver in most games, is anti-motivational for me. Yes I feel it, yes I want
						to win. But if <em>anyone</em> loses I feel like I lost.</li>
					<li>Completion of all-the-things can drive me through a game, but I leave feeling hollow hearted and
						betrayed.</li>
					<li>Why master something in play? Doesn&rsquo;t this seem like work? I enjoy work, but would like to
						either a) get paid or b) choose what I am doing.</li>
					<li>Choices in games often feel arbitrary or meaningless. Why follow a bread trail to another bread
						trail to an end screen? Why would I do that when I could sit here eating real bread and watching
						the sunbeams move?</li>
					<li>Stories are rarely written for people like me. I hear this is changing? Also, the emotional
						volume is either off or aggressively cranked up to full blast. I get overstimulated and fall out
						of the plot.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I&rsquo;d almost always rather be sitting under the tree drinking tea with you, wandering by the
					water and daydreaming, or making weird art in the wider world outside. </p>
				<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s why I make games as an art practice. I make games because I don't like playing
					games. I believe there are entire universes outside what&rsquo;s been done so far, and some of them
					might even fit someone like me, or you. </p>
				<p>We might as well take a look, anyway.</p>
				<p>M</p>
