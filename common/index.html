        <h1 class="h1">Common </h1>
        <p class="quote"><strong>What does it mean to build trust in
            play?</strong></p>

        <p>I made Common for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cafka.org/page/about">CAFKA â€“ Contemporary Art Forum
            Kitchener and Area</a> and it was played by hundreds of people in the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and
          Cambridge over the span of a month in
          2018.</p>


        <p>Common is an experimental video game for communities. It is an exploration of decentralized networks of care
          and community trust.</p>
        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-layers.png" alt="common layers" class="wide-image image">

        <h2>How Common works</h2>
        <p>Common begins with a single player shining brightly in a vast nothingness. The player's life-force is
          decreasing and they are slowly eroding. </p>
        <p>A player generates new life-force by making and reinforcing connections with other players. Strength accrues
          and flows and increases the life-force
          of each player as well as the life-force of the larger network.</p>

        <div class="vidContent">
          <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/666646813?h=c30bb06eb4&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="vidContent">
          <iframe title="Common Video" width="560" height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9iT2ZaOzV8?autoplay=0&showinfo=0&loop=1&list=u_cLu4XM1uM&rel=0"
            frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div> -->
        <br>
        <p>There is an entropic force constantly deteriorating the life-force and connections of all players. Giant
          networks may split into subnetworks if the players fail to reinforce their connections. And a player without
          connections will float
          out into the void alone. </p>

        <p>The only way a player can join Common is by meeting up with an existing player face-to-face. Both players
          must hold down the connective buttons at the same time until a connection is formed.</p>


        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-connecting.png" alt="connecting people" class="wide-image image">


        <p>For an entire month I stationed myself at different public spaces so that anyone
          curious to join could come and find me and begin play. </p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-waiting.png" alt="ready to play with people" class="wide-image image">


        <p>The entirety of the game is shaped by the collective and individual decisions of the players.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/co-play.png" alt="play screen" class="wide-image image">

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>Common is an exploration of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shared experience as a political act</li>
          <li>Community trust as something that is built through attention, care, and stewardship</li>
          <li>Communities as living entities, requiring continuous investment</li>
          <li>Current anxieties around trust as expressed through blockchain technologies and decentralization</li>
          <li>The relationship between individualism, transparency, surveillance, collaboration, and trust</li>
          <li>Attention and care as intrinsically valuable labour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>

            <li>How does trust work in a system?</li>

        <h2>Process:</h2>
        <p>Common took nine wonderful months to design, 90 agonizing days to build, and 30 magical days to play.</p>
        <p>While researching I explored many fields: from historical interpretations of "faith", to deep dives into
          decentralized organizing practices, to Game Theory. I even participated in a blockchain hackathon at the World
          Crypto Economic Forum.</p>
        <p>Common is the most conceptually, creatively, and technically challenging project I have ever worked on.</p>

        <h2>Community and Collaborators</h2>
        <p>Common was the first game where I actively sought out mentors. Thank you to Tiffany Conroy for frontend
          mentorship, Sarah Friend for everything related to the Ethereum blockchain, Eir&iacute;kr &Aring;sheim and
          Aaron Levin for mentorship
          with
          the backend. Thank you to Gordon Hatt for giving me the opportunity to make a game for an entire city. The
